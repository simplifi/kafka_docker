	Long: `Start up docker-compose with kafka.
	Scans the docker-compose.yml file and finds a kafka container, and ensures that the advertised connection
	is set correctly to allow the host to connect, but still allow inter-container communication.

	Usage:
	Starting up docker-compose:
	kafka_docker up [-f /path/to/docker-compose.yml]

	For symmetry also there is kafka_docker down, which just calls docker-compose down.

	Defaults to looking in $PWD for the docker-compose.yml
	`,
